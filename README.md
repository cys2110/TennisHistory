# TennisHistory

This is a project in progress. The main branch is the current version built with Sequelize (PostgreSQL), Node, Express and Vuetify.

There are two branches. The first, named 'django', is an earlier version of the project built with Django and Vue.

The second, named 'dev', is currently in production. This version is currently in production as I work to migrate the project to TypeScript as well as layering in Tailwind CSS. This will also address bugs that are currently in the project such as certain stats not showing up correcting.

A future version is planned as well which will introduce GraphQL to the project.
