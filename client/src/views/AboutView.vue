            <p class="text-zinc-400">This website allows viewers users to discover information about past tennis tournaments, both ATP and Davis Cup. This is solely geared towards men's singles since I am working solo on this and therefore trying to include women's tennis or men's doubles would be even more of a monstrous task! Not all data has been uploaded and is being gradually uploaded.</p>
