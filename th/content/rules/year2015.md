### Rules

::tabs{color="secondary" size="lg"}

:::tabs-item{label="Base Rules"}

- All tournaments are counted on the upcoming Monday immediately after they end. Once into the system, tournaments are counted for 52 weeks.
- The rankings are published on every Monday of the year. The exception to this rule are the mid-Mondays of tournaments lasting for more than one week.
- All players must count all mandatory events for which they are a direct acceptance on the original acceptance list. In addition, they must count their other 6 best results from all other tournaments.
- If the player is not part of the original main draw acceptance list of a mandatory event and decides not to participate before the draw is released, they may count an extra non-mandatory event.
- In weeks in which a player does not have the mandatory 12 events, he is allowed to count extra non-mandatory events to a total of 18.
- Once a player becomes part of the main draw of any of the 12 mandatory events, either as a qualifier, lucky loser, direct acceptance, special exempt or wild card, that tournament counts for his rankings. Any late withdrawal will result in a 0-point penalty.
